# pwaHomework

I was given the task of turning a previous class project into a high performance, PWA application. My instructions were the following: 

- The app should be installable as a PWA
- The app should have API routes and HTML routes
- Parts of the application should work offline
-The application should look the same online or offline
- You will need to implement:
manifest.webmanifest
service-worker.js
- Implement the compression npm library
- Deploy your application to heroku
- Test your application with lighthouse
